    Method decorator used to handle plugin availability on Spyder.

    The methods that use this decorator must have the following signature:
    `def method(self)` when observing a single plugin or

    all plugins that were listed as dependencies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func: Callable
        Method to decorate. Given by default when applying the decorator.
    plugin: Optional[str]
        Name of the requested plugin whose availability triggers the method.

    -------
    func: Callable
        The same method that was given as input.
